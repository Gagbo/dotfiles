#+TITLE: Dotfiles repository

* Purpose
  This repo stores almost all the relevant dotfiles I would wish to take with
me if I had to install on a new computer to do my stuff on. Currently this
includes :
  - Vim8/Nvim config (standalone in vim-setup)
    - This means the install process here clones the repo before stowing it
  - Emacs config (standalone in emacs-setup)
    - This means the install process here clones the repo before stowing it
  - Zsh config
  - Kitty config
  - i3 config
